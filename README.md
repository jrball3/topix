Topix

Topix is a theme-based competitive group chat game.
Players can create a topic (thread) and add their friends.
A topic is a limited-life thread of messages with a leaderboard.
To win a topic, a player must reach the set karma for the topic, or have
the highest karma at the end of the timer.
Karma are awarded to a player for upvotes on their messages by others.
Karma are taken from a player for downvotes on their messages by others.

The challenge of executing this game properly is coming up with a scoring
scheme that incentivizes players to vote on others posts, but also make
posts of their own, and prevent abuse.

Players should be anonymous, and get to choose a nickname unique to each topic.
Giving away your identity could bias the votes.  We also don't want to show
who's post belongs to who, so players can't purposely avoid upvoting the
winning player.


Minimum players per topic: 3
The game does not work with 2.
Anonymity is key.


Game Type: Karma Hole
Players will start with 50 karma.
Player to reach 100 karma first wins.
If noone reaches 100 karma, time limit and highest karma wins.
You may not incur negative karma.

1) Posting a message costs 5 karma.
2) A downvote costs 5 karma to downvoter, costs 10 karma to downvoted.
3) A upvote awards 5 karma to upvoter, award 10 karma to upvoted.

If a player reaches 0 karma, they may upvote to earn 5 karma, then post
a message. A player who is stuck upvoting to post another message is stuck
in a "karma hole".
