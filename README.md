Topix

Topix is a theme-based competitive group chat game.
Players can create a topic (thread) and add their friends.
A topic is a limited-life thread of messages with a leaderboard.
To win a topic, a player the highest amount of points at the end of the timer.
Points are awarded to a player for upvotes on their messages by others.
Points are taken from a player for downvotes on their messages by others.

The challenge of executing this game properly is coming up with a scoring
scheme that incentivizes players to vote on others posts, but also make
posts of their own, and prevent abuse.

Players should be anonymous, and get to choose a nickname unique to each topic.
Giving away your identity could bias the votes.  We also don't want to show
who's post belongs to who, so players can't purposely avoid upvoting the
winning player.


Minimum players per topic: 3
The game does not work with 2.
Anonymity is key.


Game Type: The Costly Post
Players will start with a certain amount of points. This should scale with the number of players in the topic.
If there are 3-5 players, each player will start with 5 points. 5+ Players, Start with points = 2 * players.

1) Posting a message costs 1 point.
    - The idea is that we don't want the thread to just fill up with random messages and attempts to get upvotes,
      we want the players to think about the post first. Earning upvotes and upvoting others earns additional
      rights to make more posts. 
2) Upvotes award the upvoting player 3 points, and award the player who posted the message 5 points.
    - We want to reward players for upvoting others. If we don't then why upvote anyone else?
3) Downvotes costs the downvoting player 2 points, and cost the player who posted the message 5 points.
    - We want to penalize players who downvote others, but penalize the downvoted player more.  We don't want
      players to go on downvoting sprees.
